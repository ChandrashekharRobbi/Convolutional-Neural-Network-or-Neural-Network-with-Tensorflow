# Regression Neural Networks

In this Directory i am going to upload all the regression problem projects by using Convolutional Neural Network / Neural Network with Tensorflow 


## What are regression Problems?

First Let's understand what is **Regression**?


Regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series of other variables (known as independent variables).

Or in simple words we can say that the model has to predict some numbers by using few parameters.


In Regression problem there are many evaluation metrices present to know how good the model is 


Evaluation metrices are 
1. MAE ( Mean Absolute Error )
2. MSE ( Mean Square Error )
