# Medical Insurance 


In this project i have used the medical insurance dataset from the kaggle website to predict the charges of the medical insurance by using few parameters

It was a number right??

Then this problem is a **Regression Problem**


Like wise i did this project in several steps


The steps include:
1. Understand the data

It is very necessary to understand the data because it makes clear about the parameters / features present in the dataset and it is also necessary to visualize them to understand much better

3. Create the model
4. Evaluate the model
5. Improve the model
