# Fashion Mnist

This project comes under **Multi-Class Classification**



Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.


The classes look some thing like this

I have followed certain steps which include:

# 1. Visualize the data

# 2. Create Baseline Model
    * Create the model
  
  
      The baseline model is of 3 dense layers and 1 Flatten layers , output layer i have set to **softmax** because of the mulit class classification problem.
      
      
  2.2 Compile the model
  
  
      here i have used three parameters:
        * 



3.Evaluate the model
4.Improve the model
