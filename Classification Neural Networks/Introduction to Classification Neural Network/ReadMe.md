# Introduction to Classification Neural Networks

In this notebook i have used built in data set of `make_circles` which would be easy for understanding classification convolutional Neural Network

I have followed certain steps which include:
1. Visualize the data
2. Create the model
3. Evaluate the model
4. Improve the model


## Visualize the data

Firstly we have to understand the data pretty well to make predictions or we can say easy for creating a model

Our data set something look like the below plot :)

isn't that beautiful? 
Which put us in excitment to learn more about it :)
